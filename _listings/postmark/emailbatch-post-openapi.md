  title: Postmark Post Email Batch
  description: "While Postmark is focused on transactional email, we understand that
    developers with higher volumes or processing time constraints need to send their
    messages in batches. To facilitate this we provide a batching endpoint that permits
    you to send up to 500 well-formed Postmark messages in a single API call.\n                    \nThe
    format of the batched message is a JSON array containing multiple message requests
    like the following example:\n[\n    {From: 'sender@example.com', To: 'receiver1@example.com',
    Subject: 'Postmark test #1', HtmlBody: 'Hello dear Postmark user.'},\n    {From:
    'sender@example.com', To: 'receiver2@example.com', Subject: 'Postmark test #2',
    HtmlBody: 'Hello dear Postmark user.'}\n]\n\nYou can use SSL encryption by issuing
    requests to https://api.postmarkapp.com/email/batch.\n\nSimilarly, you will receive
    a matching JSON array containing each response for the messages you sent in your
    batched call:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"ErrorCode\" : 0,\n        \"Message\" : \"OK\",\n
    \       \"MessageID\" : \"b7bc2f4a-e38e-4336-af7d-e6c392c2f817\",\n        \"SubmittedAt\"
    : \"2010-11-26T12:01:05.1794748-05:00\",\n        \"To\" : \"receiver1@example.com\"\n
    \   },\n    {\n        \"ErrorCode\" : 0,\n        \"Message\" : \"OK\",\n        \"MessageID\"
    : \"e2ecbbfc-fe12-463d-b933-9fe22915106d\",\n        \"SubmittedAt\" : \"2010-11-26T12:01:05.1794748-05:00\",\n

      summary: Post Email
      description: "Sends e-mails. Currently Postmark supports JSON message format.
        The mail message format is:\n\n{\n    \"From\" : \"sender@example.com\",\n
        \   \"To\" : \"receiver@example.com\",\n    \"Cc\" : \"copied@example.com\",\n
        \   \"Bcc\": \"blank-copied@example.com\",\n    \"Subject\" : \"Test\",\n
        \   \"Tag\" : \"Invitation\",\n    \"HtmlBody\" : \"Hello\",\n    \"TextBody\"
        : \"Hello\",\n    \"ReplyTo\" : \"reply@example.com\",\n    \"Headers\" :
        [{ \"Name\" : \"CUSTOM-HEADER\", \"Value\" : \"value\" }],\n    \"Attachments\":
        [\n        {\n             \"Name\": \"readme.txt\",\n             \"Content\":
        \"dGVzdCBjb250ZW50\",\n             \"ContentType\": \"text/plain\"\n        },\n
        \       {\n            \"Name\": \"report.pdf\",\n            \"Content\":
        \"dGVzdCBjb250ZW50\",\n            \"ContentType\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n
        \       }\n    ]\n}\n\nYou should pass the json encoded message in the body
        of the request. Both from and to accept name, in the format of John Doe .
        You can provide HtmlBody for html formatted messages, TextBody for plain text,
        or both for multipart. Multipart sends html with a text version for clients
        that don\u2019t support html. Passing headers is optional.\n\n1. You should
        have a registered and confirmed sender signature with the sender email. Otherwise
        you will receive HTTP Response 422 (Unprocessable Entity).\n2. It is possible
        to override the Name in the sender signature through the API. This is useful
        if you want to use member\u2019s information in the email while keeping your
        from email address. just pass the name in the From parameter, From: \"John
        Smith \".\n3. You can pass multiple recipient addresses in the \u2018To\u2019
        field and the optional \u2018Cc\u2019 and \u2018Bcc\u2019 fields. Separate
        multiple addresses with a comma. Note that Postmark has a limit of twenty
        recipients per message in total. You need to take care not to exceed that
        limit. Otherwise you will get an error.\n4. You can categorize outgoing email
        using the optional Tag property. If you use different tags for the different
        types of emails your application generates, you will be able to get detailed
        statistics for them through the Postmark user interface.\n\nAttachments\nAttachments
        are specified in the Attachments array property. An attachment is an object
        that has to provide the file name (via the Name property), the content type
        (ContentType property) and the actual binary data (Content property) that
        has to be sent with the message.\n\nThe name is the actual file name that
        will be displayed to the message recipient. Note that the file extension is
        important. To eliminate the possibility of spreading viruses or spyware we
        allow only a number of file types. That is, instead of using a list of forbidden
        files and risking an unanticipated file type spreading infections, we have
        taken the opposite approach \u2014 we whitelist document file types that we
        are certain are safe. Here is the list of allowed files:\n\n- Media files:
        gif, jpg, jpeg, png, swf, flv, avi, mpg, mp3, mp4, ogv, wav, rm, mov, psd,
        ai, tif, tiff\n- Documents: txt, rtf, htm, html, pdf, epub, mobi, doc, docx,
        ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, ps, eps, iif\n- Miscellaneous: log, csv, ics, xml, zip\n\nContact
        us if you feel we need to whitelist a file that your application needs.\n\nThe
        content type is the MIME content type that email clients use to interpret
        various attachments such as: text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, etc. Your
        code can either detect it by the file extension, use a third party library
        to infer it, ask the user to provide it or just default to application/octet-stream.\n\nThe
        binary data has to be transmitted as a base64-encoded string. Most programming
        languages and libraries have this built in e.g. Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby.\n\nYou
        can use SSL encryption by issuing requests to https://api.postmarkapp.com/email.\n\nSuccess\nIf
        all goes well, you will get back a JSON message looking a lot like:\n\n{\n
        \   \"ErrorCode\" : 0,\n    \"Message\" : \"OK\",\n    \"MessageID\" : \"b7bc2f4a-e38e-4336-af7d-e6c392c2f817\",\n
        \   \"SubmittedAt\" : \"2010-11-26T12:01:05.1794748-05:00\",\n    \"To\" :
        \"receiver@example.com\"\n}\n\nNote the MessageID property. You can log it
        in your system and use it to associate the message you just sent to a possible
        bounce that you obtained from a bounce web hook or the bounce API."
